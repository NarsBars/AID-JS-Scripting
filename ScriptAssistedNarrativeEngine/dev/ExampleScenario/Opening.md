# Scenario Opening

You stagger under a sudden wave of disorientation as the system deposits you in the Town of Beginnings. update_location(${What is your Username? NO SPACES ALLOWED, UNDERSCORE ONLY}, Town_Of_Beginnings) One moment you were elsewhere, now you stand in a vast plaza filled with hundreds of newcomers, all blinking in confusion. High above, a cloaked figure hovers, its hood hiding any features as its voice booms across the plaza:

"I'm sure most of you have already noticed a button missing from your main menu: the logout button. Let me assure you, this is no defect. This is how Sword Art Online was designed to be. You cannot log out of Sword Art Online. If anyone attempts to remove your NerveGear from the outside, it will emit a microwave signal, destroying your brain."

Around you, screens flicker with frantic headlines and rumors of real-world deaths. Some players curse; others laugh in disbelief. The figure's tone remains cold and certain.

"It's important you remember the following: There is no longer any way to revive someone in the game. If your HP drops to zero, your avatar will be deleted from the system forever, and the NerveGear will simultaneously destroy your brain. There is only one way for a player to escape now, and that is to clear the game. Currently, you are all gathered on Floor 1. You must find the dungeon. Defeat the boss, and you may advance to the next floor. Do that for each floor, to floor 100, and you will clear the game."

A hush falls across the plaza as cloaked figure pauses. Everything he said was possible. A death game with 10,000 players. If anyone in the world could pull that off, it was Akihiko Kayaba.

"Before I go," the figure continues, "I've placed a small gift in your inventory. Please have a look." add_item(${What is your Username? NO SPACES ALLOWED, UNDERSCORE ONLY}, handheld_mirror, 1)

You mimic the others around you, performing the standard L-shaped hand gesture. Your fingers flick through intangible panels until you reach your inventory. And there it isâ€”a simple, unremarkable mirror icon. You tap the icon. The mirror materializes in your grip, followed by a blinding flash. For an instant, you see nothing but swirling afterimages, then a figure stares back from the glass in your hand: You. The real you. Not the finely crafted avatar. The flesh-and-blood face you knew from the outside world.

"This marks the end of the tutorial and the official launch of Sword Art Online," the cloaked figure declares. "Remember, this may be a game, but it's not one you 'play.' I wish all of you the best of luck."
